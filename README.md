# Project Overview

This project contains several Python scripts that perform different tasks related to recipe calculations and Fibonacci sequence generation.

## File Descriptions

### 1. value of the SOMA variable at the end of processing

Here, SOMA is initialized to 0. The loop increments K up to 13 and accumulates the value of K in SOMA. The sum will be the total of 1 + 2 + 3 ... + 13.

### Checking whether a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence

`fib/fibonacci.py`

This script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. It also includes a function to check whether a given number is part of the generated Fibonacci sequence.

### 3. daily billing for a distribution company

`fat/billing.py`

This script processes revenue data from JSON and XML files. It combines the data, filters out days with zero revenue and calculates metrics such as the lowest and highest daily revenue, as well as days with revenue above the monthly average.

### 4. Percentage of turnover by state

`dis/final_state.py`

This script calculates the percentage of monthly revenue by state. It defines a dictionary with revenue data, calculates the total revenue and then calculates each state's percentage contribution to the total revenue.

### 5 Inverting characters in a string

`inv/inversao.py`
This script inverts the order of the characters in a string. It defines a function that receives a string as input and returns the string with the characters inverted.
